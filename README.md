# Architecture-Manual
[Under Construction] Here is a manual to When to use What .. Why to use What and How to use it? (I hope to cover programming languages, Frameworks and Technologies)

Since I started to learn programming in 2008 and I have always the question When to use What and Why then the final question is How.

During my small journey with software engineering, I used different languages, frameworks, and technologies. Also till now, I worked on 5 different companies with different mentalities, tech-stacks and I'm trying to sum up this experiences.

I worked on projects which use (C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, Nodejs, TS, Scala, Go). So I have always been asked what is difference between Python and Ruby for example and when to use Ruby and when to use Python ..etc


So here I'm trying to split things to have something like manual or matrix to help when I'm designing developing a new thing / refactor or even answer some common questions I kept know and forget its answer.

I'll gonna start with programming languages and then be trying to scale up to frameworks, technologies and integration different parts together. I'll start with a basic iteration trying to build the basic layer then return back and go deeper.

# Programming Languages

## C++
### When
`uses of C++ when you have intensive functions of CPU and want to have more control over hardware. When you need low-level access or control to your running instance resources. Also with applications that use threading intensively`

### Why
`This language is very fast because it has a very low level/control with low-level resources. So it's widely used in developing different Games or in Gaming engines, Databases (MySql, Bloomberg RDBMS), Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, etc), Web Browsers (Chrome), Media Access (Media players), Compilers, Scanners, Animation (3D Animation, Modeling, Simulation, Rendering software), Applications (many Adobe applications like Illustrator)`

### How
`C++ is widely used among the programmers or developers mainly in an application domain. It contains the important parts including the core language providing all the required building blocks including variable, data types, literals, etc. It supports object-oriented programming including its features like Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction. These concepts make the C++ language different and mostly in use for developing the applications easily and conceptualized.`
